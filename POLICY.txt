ORGNAME Security and Vulnerability Reporting Policy

1. Services Covered by this Policy

This policy covers all services directly operated by us (ORGNAME).
Services can be identified by the following means:
- The website has a .well-known/security.txt that links to this policy.
- The reverse DNS of an IP address resolves to one of the following
  domains: example.com

2. Classification of Vulnerabilities

We consider vulnerabilities as relevant when they meet one or more of
the following conditions:
- The vulnerability can be used to directly access non-public
  information that either reveals further security relevant problems or
  contains user data.
- The vulnerability can be used to disrupt the orderly operation of a
  service.
- The vulnerability can be used to manipulate data within the service.
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Broken Authentication and Session Management
- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- Remote Code Execution
- Insecure Direct Object Reference
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- Security Misconfiguration
- Missing Function Level Access Control
- Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
- Directory/Path transversal
- Exposed credentials
etc are considered relevant.

  
Certain vulnerabilities are considered out-of-scope for this Security 
and Vulnerability Reporting Policy. Those out-of-scope vulnerabilities
include, but are not limited to:
- Social Engineering attacks
- Account enumeration using brute-force attacks
- Weak password policies and password complexity requirements
- Missing http security headers which do not lead to a vulnerability
- Reports from automated tools or scans
- Presence of autocomplete attribute on web forms
- Missing cookie flags on non-sensitive cookies
- Reports of SSL/TLS issues, best practices or insecure ciphers
- Self-exploitation attacks
- Test versions of applications
- Mail configuration issues including SPF, DKIM, DMARC settings
- Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on unauthenticated forms or
  forms with no sensitive actions
- Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.
- Previously known vulnerable libraries without 
  a working Proof of Concept.
- Comma Separated Values (CSV) injection without 
  demonstrating a vulnerability.
- Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DoS).
- Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing 
  an attack vector/without being able to modify HTML/CSS
- Rate limiting or bruteforce issues on non-authentication endpoints
- Missing best practices in Content Security Policy.
- Missing HttpOnly or Secure flags on cookies
- Vulnerabilities only affecting users of outdated or unpatched browsers
- Software version disclosure / Banner identification issues / 
  Descriptive error messages or headers (e.g. stack traces, 
  application or server errors).
- Tabnabbing
- Open redirect - unless an additional security impact can be demonstrated
- Issues that require unlikely user interaction
- Solutions affected by known CVEs published less than 30 days ago

3. Reporting Vulnerabilities

Report vulnerabilities via e-mail to security@example.com. For
encryption the PGP key https://example.com/pubkey.asc can be used.

Please make sure that you include the following information:
- Which service is affected
- How can the bug be used/exploited
- Explanation of the risk

Reports will be answered within 48 hours. If you have not received an
answer within that time frame, please make sure to contact us again.

4. Bug Bounties / Vulnerability Rewards

The amount of reward payed depends on the severity of the found
vulnerability. We usually do not pay rewards if vulnerabilities can be
found in mass scans with of-the-shelf software.

5. Acknowledgement

We list recognized reports of vulnerablities online if the reporting
security researcher agrees. The name, contact e-mail address, and type of
vulnerability can be included in the list. Our public acknowledgements
can be found at https://example.com/security-acknowledgements.html.
